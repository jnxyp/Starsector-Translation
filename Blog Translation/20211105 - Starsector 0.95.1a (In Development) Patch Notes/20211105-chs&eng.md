## Changes as of November 05, 2021
## 截至2021年11月5日所做的修改：

### Campaign 生涯模式:
- Custom production mission (except for arms dealer) no longer offered at player's colonies
- Scuttling ships with s-mods you've built in will now grant bonus XP
  - The total bonus XP from building in the hullmods and from scuttling the ship is 100%
  - Ships with s-mods that you didn't build in do not grant bonus XP when scuttled
  - This bonus XP is also gained of a ship with s-mods you've built in is lost and not recovered
- Story raids made more difficult
- Light-years map legend no longer shown in star system map view, only in hyperspace
- Dialog for picking elite officer skills now allows picking multiple skills at once
- Officers at or beyond max level and with maxed out elite skills can be "retrained"
  - Elite skills changed
  - Personality changed (+- 1 step)
  - Costs 1 story point and grants 100% bonus XP
  - Works on level 7 cryopod officers
- Significantly increased XP required for officers to level up
- Uncoupled story point gain rate after reaching maximum level from what the actual maximum level is
  - Only matters if the maximum level is increased beyond the vanilla maxium
  - Before this change, doing this would make story point gain at max level significantly slower
- Significantly increased XP required to go from level 1 to level 5
- Somewhat less significantly increased the XP to go from level 5 to 10, as well
- Officers found in sleeper pods:
  - Now either level 5 or level 7 (no level 6)
  - Level 7 pod-officers have 5 elite skills
- Number of level 7 ones is limited to 4 per Sector total
  - If less than that spawn during Sector creation, they can be found in new derelict ships
- Increased mercenary officer contract duration to 2 cycles (was: 1 cycle)
- Increased max number of recoverable ships to 24 normal/24 "difficult" recovery (was: 16 and 16)
- Reduced variability in loadouts in AI-controlled fleets and in general improved their quality
- Missions will present the player with a map showing the initial destination/mission target's location
  - Can also open the intel screen when this map is shown
- Significantly reduced supply cost to stabilize cargo pods
- Interdiction Pulse: now slows the fleet using the ability instead of stopping it
- Added slipstreams to hyperspace
  - New slipstream systems form in hyperspace twice per cycle
  - Can drastically speed up travel and cut fuel use
  - Loosely follow certain patterns that can be figured out
- Added sensor ghosts to hyperspace
- Raiding:
  - Fixed issue that was causing too many blueprints to be found on smaller colonies
  - Blueprint drops no longer entirely based on which are already known
  - Fixed case where having more marines could sometimes increase casualties for the same raid
  - Stability penalty now based on number marine tokens committed to raid
  - Fixed issue that was preventing repeated raids from reducing the availability of supplies (and other commodities) at pirate and Pather bases
  - Reduced the base number of commodities (supplies etc) from raiding by 80%
  - Functionally, raiding is now *much* more profitable where there is excess on the market
  - And stops being profitable for a given commodity once that excess goes away
  - Amount of deficit caused by raiding is unchanged
  - Reduced number of commodities gained when raiding a commodity that has an "excess" on the market
  - Still highly profitable
  - Fixes exploit of selling to create an excess, then raiding back more than was sold
  - Reduced marine casualties from raids
  - Fixed issue where multiple custom raid objectives would show up when only one of them should have given the context
  - Fixed issue with "time until commotion dies down" text not being highlighted in some cases
- Post-battle "consider ship recovery" option will now use the story color when only "difficult" recovery is available
- During post-battle ship recovery, if ships on your side were lost, continuing without recovery will go through a confirmation dialog
- Distress calls will no longer be generated from a system with disrupted jump-points
- Commerce: reduced base income bonus to 25% (was: 50%)
- Trade fleet departure intel will not be deleted after fleet's departure if it's marked important
- Production report intel will not be deleted for at least 30 days and not at all if marked important
- Star system that becomes permanently inaccessible REDACTED will now become accessible again after around a cycle
- Removed "major events" tag from intel as it wasn't actually used by anything
- Arms dealers:
  - Significantly increased probability of arms dealers being found in bars
  - Improved inventory available
    - For example, a "very low" importance dealer would have a good selection of small weapons of one type
  - No longer restricted to just "rare" ships/weapons/fighters
- Ships will have high production quality regardless of colony the order is placed in; at most 1 d-mod
  - Reduced markup cost to 200% (was: 300%), and to 150% when at 100 relationship (was: 200%)
- Added the new colony-related items to Tech Mining's initial finds
- Slightly reduced drop date of colony-related items from various salvage
- Added Fullerene Spool to Eventide (this ensures Sindria's fuel production is in full swing)
- Population growth penalty shown in hazard rating tooltip now accounts for colony size
- Removed low stability requirement from "mercs and the run" bar event so it should show up more frequently
- Cancelling an in-progress industry upgrade now only refunds 75% of the cost (unless the progress is zero)
- Increased length of time patrols are willing to pursue for
  - Primarly, this makes it more possible to distract them and go around
- Added "introduce false readings" option to sensor arrays
  - Patrols and similar fleets may go to investiage these
- Added new mission that takes the player to the Galatia Academy
- Interacting with abandoned stations (such as the one around Asharu) now plays the salvage/survey music
- Toned down high end pirate bounties (far too many capital ships due to an oversight)
- Limited maximum supply use for being over capacity to 50 per day per type of capacity, i.e. 150 total
- Various campaign missions: added text showing currently available credits where it was missing
- Campaign tutorial: made initial quicksave instruction more difficult to miss

### Skills 技能系统:
- Note: this list is not comprehensive, but should cover the main changes
- Skill effect text now shown at full brightness
  - Unless the player has the skill but not its elite effect, in which case the latter is dark to make it clear it's not unlocked
- Rearranged skills in a different tier structure for each aptitude, retaining 2 top-tier picks in each
- Choose enough skills in lower tiers to unlock the next tier
- Can skip a tier by taking more skills in lower tiers instead
- Skills within a tier are no longer mutually exclusive
  - Reaching the top tier requires 4 points, plus 1 more to actually take a top-tier skill
  - Taking the second top-tier skill requires spending 2 more points in lower tiers, plus 1 more for the skill, for 8 points in the aptitude total
    - This replaces wrapping around entirely
  - Skills that have been made elite and reassigned can be re-made elite at no cost
- Elite skill levels are generally a bit more powerful
- All skills can be unassigned, there are no more permanent skills
  - Unassigning skills that gave additional s-mods will result in s-mods being removed (the player can choose which for the ships in their fleet)
  - Unassigning skills that boosted officer level/elite skills will result in either the officer becoming a mercenary on a new contract, or losing excess skills
  - And so on

  - Could cause it to teleport to unsafe locations
  - Could cause it to teleport away from danger too conservatively
- Fixed issue that could cause the AI to fire too many HE missiles at an overloaded target despite being aware that it was overkill
- Fixed issue that was causing autofiring weapons shooting at a phased ship not be concerned about friendly fire
- Removed code responsible for making the AI try not to waste a large ship's time chasing down a small one and regroup with nearby allies instead

- Improved awareness of danger posed by the High Intensity Laser
- Ships assigned to escort another ship will now engage the escortee's target more aggressively if there are no flankers to defend against
- Fixed issue that caused ships to sometimes base their movement direction on presence of nearby friendly fighters
  - E.G. Tempest not reliably flanking a slower enemy
  - Issue only affected specific situations; had limited/no impact when facing multiple enemies
