## **摘要（译者添加）**

Technically, the next release was meant to be a “bugfixing and polish” release. It’s true that the [skill system update](https://fractalsoftworks.com/2021/07/02/skill-changes-part-1/) already pushes the boundaries of that, but still, we’ve somehow ended up with some major new features, too, which will be discussed in this post. The short answer to “how did we get here” is “weeeeell, one thing led to another, and before you know it…”

按理来说，游戏的下次更新应专注于修复bug和打磨细节。虽然上次对于[技能系统的更新](https://www.fossic.org/thread-3124-1-1.html)已经破例了一次，但最终我还是给游戏添加了一些主要的新功能，并将在本文中予以介绍。你要是问为啥又开始搞新功能了，简单来说就是搞了一个就想搞另一个，然后不知不觉地就变成这样了...

![][stream1]

I’d actually like to give a longer answer, too. The first thing I want to say, though, is that this is ok! Ultimately, it’s all stuff that was going to be in the game one way or another (though the specific form would depend on exactly how it happened), so as long as it’s added in a way that lets it fit into the existing mechanics nicely, it’s all good.

I could have held off on adding these until a later release – there’s something to be said for sticking with a plan. But also, I think it’s important to take advantage of inspiration when it strikes – and to occasionally, have some fun!

一个更为详细的回答是，我认为这样没什么问题。毕竟这些内容迟早都要加入到游戏中（尽管表现形式可能有所不同），所以只要新内容的表现形式能使其很好地融入到现有的机制中，就都没问题。

我也可以将这些内容推迟到后续的版本中，毕竟遵守开发计划有其道理所在。但我认为，抓住一闪而逝的灵感也同样重要——偶尔也得给自己找点乐子！

So, how did we get here? A little shy of two months ago, I thought to myself: “I’ve got this document about sensor ghosts laying around, I bet I could just knock these out in a week”. To be fair, I probably could have, but one of the tricky parts of gamedev is deciding how far to follow an idea. Is it something that’s not strictly necessary, or is it something that’s crucial to making the rest of it “click”? There’s a time to cut ruthlessly, and a time to follow through.

所以，这套东西是怎么搞出来的？不到两个月以前，我心想：“我已经构思好了关于‘传感器幽灵’的细节，一周之内绝对能在游戏里整出来”。讲道理，我大概的确可以做到，但游戏开发中棘手的一点，就是决定你要在一个想法上投入多少精力。有的想法可能对于游戏来说并不重要，而有的则可能是使整个游戏大放异彩的关键所在。对于前者，所需的时间可以被无情地消减；而对后者，则需付出更多的坚持。

The idea, in this case, was that I wanted a certain type of sensor ghost to leave behind it a wake that made it easy to follow. This is a big deal, mechanics-wise – it has implications for how travel in hyperspace fundamentally works! If you can take advantage of these kinds of “slipstreams” to get around faster, that’ll shape gameplay. “Sensor ghosts” without that element – they’d work, sure, and there’s plenty of other mechanics there to keep things lively (and spooky), but cutting out the “wake” idea felt like leaving something vital on the table.

So, I thought to myself, alright, wake, fluid dynamics, let’s read some papers and hack something together. A basic velocity field implementation (not “mathematically correct” in any sense, just “good enough”) looked something like this:

而这次我的想法是，在超空间中，有某种出现在传感器上的不明移动目标；为了方便玩家追踪这传感器上的幽灵，其会在其身后留下一条尾迹。这条尾迹类似于一条**滑流**：玩家可以在其中加速航行，更快地穿梭来往。从游戏机制的角度来说，这无疑会对超空间中的航行方式产生重大的影响，进而改变游戏的玩法。到头来，就算去掉所谓的“传感器幽灵”，这套**在超空间中生成滑流，以便玩家快速穿梭的机制**仍然可行，我们也可以围绕其构筑更多的游戏机制，使其更加生动（和诡异）。即便如此，丢掉“幽灵的尾迹”这一想法仍然使我感到有些遗憾。

所以，我进一步想到，尾迹这玩意应该是属于流体力学的范畴，所以我应该去看点相关的论文什么的。我做了一个简单的流速场demo，虽然不符合数学原理但看起来还凑合：

> From the cutting room floor - a fluid-dynamics-inspired visual effect. Doesn't quite "work" for various reasons - too harsh looking, iffy performance, doesn't quite suit what it's needed for, but thought it was neat enough to share!
> 最终未采用的样品：受流体力学启发的一个特效。看着太粗糙，性能不稳定，效果一般，不太符合最终的需求，但值得发个贴分享下！

It looks pretty decent in motion, but it really doesn’t look good at all in a still shot:

这个特效在运动中看起来还行，但一旦视角停止移动就显得很丑。

![][pixels_stream]

It’s extremely noisy and high contrast. Trying to add some antialiasing didn’t help things much. Another attempt involved rendering it using lines instead of individual points, like this:

特效看起来有很多噪点，对比度过高。尝试过添加抗锯齿效果也没有改善。在另一次尝试中，试着用线而不是点来渲染粒子，像这样：

> A variation of the same "turbulence" effect - the underlying math is just about the same as in the previous one, but it's visualized differently, with flow lines rather than particles! Also let on the cutting room floor, for various reasons.
> 之前“湍流”特效的一个变种：其中的粒子模拟算法没什么变化，但使用了不同的渲染方式，将之前的点渲染成了线！不过最终因为各种原因，还是没有采用这一版本。

This looks a bit better, but still doesn’t cut it. In particular, this doesn’t convey any sense of “enter this area to go faster”. The “curving line” particles look pretty nice, though – so, let’s keep those, and toss the fluid dynamics. Here, unfortunately, I don’t have any screenshots, but what followed was these particles going in a straight line along a wider area. That definitely had more potential – there was finally the sense of “this is an area that’ll make you go faster”, though it still needed a lot of work.

这个效果看起来好一点，但仍然没有达到要求。具体地说，这个特效完全传达不出“进入这个区域可以走的更快”的意思。不过，用曲线来渲染的粒子看起来不错。所以，我们将只保留粒子，抛弃流体动力学的部分。虽然没有截图，但接下来干的事情，就是让这种粒子在更广阔的区域中呈直线行进——虽然还有待改进，但终于制造出了“这是一个能让你走得更快的区域”的感觉。

At this point, David got involved and suggested adding some textures and borders to the thing. I also got the idea to make it support curved shapes and varying widths; honestly not sure why – it was one of those exploratory “I could probably do it, and want to see how it’d look” type of things, rather than doing it with a specific goal in mind. The sensor ghost from a few paragraphs could only travel in a straight line, so supporting curved shapes wasn’t necessary for it.

这时候，David参与了进来。他建议给滑流添加一些材质和边界。我也有了让滑流有弯曲形状和可变宽度的想法——老实说，这种尝试并没有明确的目的，仅仅是为了探索我能做到的程度和实际的视觉效果罢了。之前提到的幽灵尾迹的设计只考虑了直线运动，并不需要这种曲线形状。

One of the earlier versions looked like this:

早期的一个版本长这样：

![][stream_basic]

Below is a shot of me debugging the curved version of the stream. The white curves represent the direction of the flow within the stream at any given point. Note how the curves start to get a little unsteady towards the very bottom – generating parallel curves is a difficult problem! Good enough, though. It’s important to note that this isn’t the actual geometry of the stream; that’d be way too many polygons – this is just rendering a bunch of debug data – curves, normals, and so on.

下面这张图是我在调试弯曲滑流时的画面。白色的曲线代表在滑流中任意一点的粒子流动方向。可以注意到在弧的内侧，白色曲线显得有些不稳定——生成平行的曲线确实不简单！不过这也差不多了。需要注意的是，这并不是滑流的实际几何形状，没有这么多的多边形。这只渲染了一堆调试数据，法线啊曲线啊什么的。

![][curve_debug]

And here’s a shot of particles following these curves!

然后这是当粒子沿这些曲线流动的样子！

![][particles_following]

And another shot, combining particles with some textures:

另一张截图，给滑流加上了材质。

![][coming_together]

Still not great by any means – but it’s looking promising; you can see how that could turn into something good with some effort. After said effort (which included David’s key suggestion of using multiple scrolling textures), it finally came together.

无论如何仍然不是很好，但未来可期。可以预见通过更多的努力，可以获得出色的效果。经过上述的哪些努力（尤其是David关于使用多个滚动的滑流背景材质的宝贵建议），我们最终大功告成：

![][stream2]

It’s worth noting that the “it finally came together” part, despite getting the fewest words, took at least as long as the rest of the process put together. There’s just not as much to talk about there – a lot of iteration and things incrementally looking and working better. There’s a “wobble” effect of the same type that the hyperspace background has (if you came from twitter: you’ve seen it! if not: the animation is embedded at the end of this post), and a border that makes it fit in with the deep hyperspace clouds, looking almost like a channel that cuts through it. The particles that it all started with are still there, too, just more subtle – but instrumental in showing the speed of the stream.

At this point, we had a really nice (if I do say so myself) looking slipstream, and it was a shame to waste it on something that only happened very occasionally. What happens if I just slap one of these across the entire Sector? … what happened, of course, was that the frame rate went through the floor. But it also looked very cool, so much optimizing followed (more on that, later).

提一句，这“最终大功告成”的步骤虽然只有六个字，但却花费了和之前所有步骤加起来差不多的时间。我们在背后进行了大量的迭代，每次都比上次好一点点，但这些也没什么可说的。我们添加了和超空间背景类似的“抖动”效果（发在Twitter上了，也贴在这篇文章末尾了），以及一个使其与深层超空间云相结合的边框，看起来像是在云里挖了个洞过去。粒子特效还是之前那种，但是把粒子缩的更小，而且可以显示滑流本身的速度。

现在，我们有了一个（我觉得）挺好看的滑流效果。这么好看的效果，要是仅出现在偶发事件中，那不就白瞎了吗？如果滑流可以出现在整个星域中，会怎么样呢？结果是，帧率跌破地板，但看着贼帅。有大量的优化工作要做，稍后细说。

What followed that was some thinking about what it’d take to actually make this good gameplay-wise. After all, this is a bit backwards – you don’t generally want to take something cool and just try to cram it in everywhere. On the other hand, it’s just an extension of the “ghost leaves a wake” idea; the fundamental concept of “use this to spice up (and speed up!) hyperspace travel is still the same.

So, we started with sensor ghosts, and ended up with Sector-spanning slipstreams. No problem, let’s just roll with it! It’s pretty common to start with one thing and have it not quite work, but eventually turn into something different that does.

接下来就是琢磨一下怎么把这一机制变成一个好的玩法了。毕竟，对于这种很酷的好东西，我们一般不希望把它随便到处乱塞进游戏里。但也不要忘了，这仅仅是“幽灵移动会留痕”这一想法的一个扩展；而其根本目的仍是使超空间旅行更加快捷和刺激。

所以，我们从传感器上的幽灵讲起，最后扯到了跨越整个星区的滑流？没毛病，干就完了！毕竟一件事情干着干着变成另一件也不是什么罕见的情况。

## Movement mechanics 在滑流中移动

Before looking at the bigger picture of, say, how to generate a layout of slipstreams in the Sector, it makes sense to make sure the fundamentals are in good shape – that moving through a slipstream feels good and is an interesting thing for the player to do. How does it work?

Starting with the obvious, slipstreams make fleets inside them go fast – we’re talking in the area of burn level 40, which is about double what can be achieved normally. Maximum speed is achieved near the center of the stream. Narrower sections are faster, while wider sections slow down considerably. This is all indicated by the movement of the particles in the stream, so is easy to get the hang of.

在开始讨论那些更大的话题之前，例如如何生成星区中的滑流布局之类的，必须首先确保滑流的基本功能运作良好。在滑流中移动需要足够有趣，并给玩家良好的体验。咋整呢？

最明显的一点，在滑流中的舰队会跑得更快，可以有高达40的航速，是一般情况下最高航速的两倍。处于流的中心可以跑得最快。滑流上较窄的部分流速较快，宽的部分较慢；可以通过观察粒子的流速来轻松地掌握情况。

To get the most speed, you need to stay in the middle of the stream. You have reasonable control over your fleet’s position inside the stream – but the faster the stream, the less control, as your fleet is carried along by the stronger current. Once you get to the middle, as long as the stream is going straight, it’s easy to stay there – but streams will generally curve a bit, and a narrow (and thus faster!) section combined with a sharper curve makes it hard to maintain your position – it’s much like spinning out on a turn on a race track. And much like in that case, you can prepare for an upcoming turn by getting on the inside track. You can see the slipstream on the radar, making this process easier.

要达到最高速度，舰队必须保持在滑流的中心。在滑流中航行时，玩家仍可以控制舰队的位置，但随着流速的加快，控制将会变得更加困难，因为滑流将裹挟着舰队一起流动。当你到达了滑流的中心，只要滑流不拐弯，那么保持在滑流中心并不困难。但滑流通常是弯曲的，而当滑流在变窄的同时突然转向，就会很难继续停留在中心，像是开赛车转弯一样。在这种情况下，你可以预先靠向弯道内侧来准备过弯。滑流的形状会显示在雷达上，应该会让这一过程简单一些。

In addition, several active abilities interact with slipstream movement. “Emergency Burn” boosts your acceleration, and lets you get around within the stream more easily – and its speed bonus gets added to your maximum speed, too. Saving an e-burn for a tight turn can be a really good idea. “Sustained Burn”, on the other hand, comes with a hefty penalty to acceleration – but its speed bonus can be handy, too. It’s useful in the calmer, wide stretches – or in straightaways. It’s also useful when there’s a break in the slipstream – engaging Sustained Burn inside a stream doesn’t stop your fleet like it would in normal space, and it can be a nice way to keep some momentum going before re-entering the stream.

除此以外，几项主动技能也可以影响在滑流中的移动。

Overall, I think that provides enough options and considerations to stay engaged. And besides, going really fast is just fun! And that brings us to another point.

(Oh, and worth noting: being inside a slipstream takes precedence over any other terrain your fleet might be in. So, for example, the bonuses/penalties from being in deep hyperspace, or in a storm, and so on, do not apply.)

## Fuel use 燃料消耗

Flying through a slipstream is fun – so we need to be really, really careful to make sure it’s definitely worth doing. No matter how we lay these out as far as the overall map of the Sector, it’s going to be rare that “through a slipstream” is the shortest way to get where the player needs to go, purely in terms of distance. And the player won’t even know exactly where the stream they’re in is going, most of the time! (More on that, later, too.)

One thing helping here is an existing mechanic – going at a speed above burn level 20 doesn’t cost extra fuel. For example, going at burn level 40, covering the same distance costs half the fuel that you’d spend covering it at burn 20. By itself, though, that isn’t enough – when you factor in the detours required to get to and from the stream, it’s often unclear whether taking a stream results in a fuel savings.

![][stream_tooltip]

Therefore: traveling through a slipstream provides an additional 50% fuel use reduction. This way, it’s going to be “worth it” for any halfway-reasonable set of detours – if taking a stream looks at all like it might be faster, it’ll also definitely be cheaper.

## Slipstream layout generation 滑流布局生成

With these lower-level mechanics squared away, the big remaining task was to figure out how a big a role slipstreams play in hyperspace travel overall, and how to generate the slipstream layout for the Sector.

To answer the first question, I don’t think slipstream travel should be something you *always* do – it should be frequent, but it should leave ample room for travel through regular hyperspace. It should be possible to be in deep hyper and not know where the nearest slipstream is. Finding one should be an exciting opportunity. This is largely a subjective feel issue, so it’s not something that’s objectively “right”, but that’s the design goal.

As far as generating a slipstream layout – I think here I’ll just talk about how it works and what effect that has/is intended to have, rather than talking about how it got there. So! First off, slipstreams are dynamic – there isn’t a single fixed layout. Instead, a new layout is generated twice per cycle, and the player only sees as much of the slipstream system on the map as they’ve explored – though unlike with sensors, merely getting near enough for it to show up on your radar is sufficient to “see” it and have it be remembered on the map.

Here’s what the player might see after exploring a bit of it:

![][stream_partial]

And here’s what a full (different) layout might look like:

![][stream_full]

These layouts are not fully procedurally generated, rather there is a pool of hand-crafted layouts which are then randomized slightly. Initially, I’d thought to generate these entirely with code, but it proved surprisingly difficult to produce nice layouts. For example, you don’t want slipstreams intersecting at a shallow angle – it becomes a mess!, and you also *do* want intersections at specific points along their lengths (where these offer more interesting choices about where to go, when the player comes to one). Hand-crafting a bunch of possible layouts was both faster and produced better results.

Combining the layout being dynamic with it also being picked from a pool of possible options means that 1) there’s an important aspect of the hyperspace map that keeps changing and is there to be discovered/explored, but 2) that it’s also learnable, and you can make inferences about what the rest of the slipstream system looks like after discovering and recognizing a portion of it. To keep things fresh, some of the handcrafted layouts have a much higher randomization factor, and can’t be relied on in the same way.

To aid in the task of mapping the slipstream system, the Neutrino Detector active ability now functions in hyperspace, and instead of detecting other fleets and similar entities, detects slipstreams instead – out to a distance of 10 light years.

![][stream_detector]

And, finally, a big feature of the system is that the general flow direction of the streams is seasonal. In the first half of the cycle, they tend to flow to the galactic east (which is like the regular east, but in hyperspace), while in the second half of the cycle, they generally flow west. This is another thing that the player can learn and plan their expeditions around.

One might ask, “but why is slipstream flow synchronized with the Domain cycle, which is an arbitrary human construct?”. I could say that the wizard did it. Or, perhaps, that it’s a good question with terrible implications. But, instead – let’s just say that this isn’t a fixed state of affairs, but at the current time in the Sector, two otherwise independent cycles have conveniently lined up.

## Encounters 遭遇战

One of the design principles of Starsector is that mechanics in the campaign should, generally speaking, funnel the player towards combat. This isn’t a hard and fast rule, there are exceptions, and the degree to which one feature or another might do that can vary – but still, it’s something to use as a guide.

With the above in mind, we could just say that slipstreams let you travel faster and lead the player towards combat simply by virtue of getting them around faster. And that’d be fine! But I think there’s potential here to do better.

One important bit of information is that slipstreams are interrupted when crossing hyperspace areas occupied by star systems. Otherwise it just looks odd, with the slipstream covering up jump-points – and trying to route streams around star systems would be too involved, never mind that there wouldn’t always be a clear path. In a fortunate turn of events, these stream breaks make for a perfect spot for an ambush!

Imagine: you’re cruising along at burn 40, switch over to Sustained Burn to cover the break more quickly, when your sensors officer reports hostiles coming in, weapons hot. Maybe you should’ve gone dark instead.

![][stream_ambush]

This sort of encounter isn’t completely random – rather, it happens if there’s a pirate base nearby. Or a Luddic Path base. Or a system with ruins. And you won’t always encounter hostiles; sometimes you might encounter mercenaries or scavengers instead. So it’s both a potential combat encounter, and a source of information for a more observant player – information that could lead into yet more combat, if they so choose. And, importantly, it’s something that can be predicted to some degree – for example, you can be more careful if you know there’s a pirate base nearby.

(This “encounter point” system is flexible, and isn’t limited to slipstreams. For example, Remnant stations will now send occasional patrols into hyperspace, provided the player has made a disturbance in their system.)

## Performance 性能

I’m not going to dig too deeply into the various optimizations required to make these run smoothly when scaled up from the original use case of “one small slipstream now and again” to “Sector-spanning network”. Mainly those were about not doing things – not generating particles unless the player is close, not recomputing certain data for segments unless they’re visible, and so on. What I wanted to show here is this screenshot, because I think it looks neat:

![][stream_bounding]

What it shows is how the game generates a bounding box for a slipstream. Taking a step back, the game often needs to know “is this fleet (or derelict ship, etc) inside a slipstream?” We could check every segment in the stream to see if it contains the entity, but that gets computationally expensive – there are a lot of slipstreams with a lot of segments, and potentially a lot of entities to check, too.

Instead, a typical approach to this sort of problem is to say “is this entity close enough to bother checking?” If not, we don’t need to do a detailed check, and that saves a lot of computation time. This works pretty well for most things, but for a Sector-wide stream, the answer to “is this entity close enough to it to check” is always “yes”, at least if we’re doing a simple distance check, which can be thought of as “is this point within a circle that contains the stream?”. The entire freakin’ Sector is in that circle.

So a bounding circle isn’t good enough, but a bounding box around the slipstream is, especially if the stream is relatively straight, since the bounding box will have a much, much smaller area. In the screenshot above, the edges of the stream’s segments are in yellow, a “convex hull” (just a polygon, really – computing this is a required intermediate step) containing all of the stream is in white, and the final bounding box – with a bit of padding – is in cyan. One thing to note is that every tenth segment is artificially widened; this is done so that the convex hull has less points in it, which speeds up the bounding box calculation.

For a slipstream that curves around a lot, this approach doesn’t help as much – the box gets a lot bigger and there’s a lot of empty space inside it, which means more unnecessary checks when entities are inside it but not inside the stream. As a further optimization, each stream is split into a bunch of subsections, each of which has a bounding box calculated for it – so, just imagine the same thing as in the screenshot above, but chained together following the shape of a longer stream. This hugs the shape of the stream closely, so we’re going to be able to rule out a lot of potential checks!

## Sensor ghosts 传感器上的幽灵

And now, we’ve come around full circle – back to the sensor ghosts that started it all. There’s now, indeed, a type of ghost that leaves a slipstream behind – but instead of being the only means of producing slipstreams, it’s instead a supplement to the main slipstream network, to be used when it happens to be going in the right direction – and when the player is quick enough to be able to hitch a ride. There’s another type, that’s fairly similar but starts off stationary, and can be herded in a specific direction by the player – needless to say, very handy if you happen to find one.

![][leviathan_ghost]

As for other sensor ghosts, it’s the sort of thing where figuring things out (or not, as the case may be) is half the fun, and I don’t want to spoil it. Let’s just say that there are many different kinds, with tie-ins into exploration, combat, certain story elements, dire implications, and several non-obvious (and entirely, intentionally unexplained) interactions with some of the active abilities.

All in all, these additions should do a lot to liven up hyperspace – which it could really use. Almost more importantly, though, they should also strengthen other aspects of the game, because of the tie-ins with abilities and combat encounters.

In case you’re not coming to the blog from twitter, by the way, here’s what the slipstream animation looks like in action:
