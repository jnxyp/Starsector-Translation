"You need to start picking up sleepovers who can keep their mouths shut about our outbound vector."

Truer words were never spoken, my friend, but it's a little late. We've got a problem, it's matched velocity with us and I'm pretty sure it's the kind of problem you either solve, or find a new mouth to breathe nothing out of when they chuck you out the lock with your throat cut. No pressure, but this doesn't look like a fight you lose and walk away from.

Better strap yourselves in. This isn't our first time on this ride.
