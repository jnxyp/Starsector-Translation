Guarantor Mikhail's remaining forces have gathered for a final push against the Revolutionary Council. The erstwhile ruler of Peremohy has been making the usual threats - impalement, mass executions, planetary bombardment - but there's every chance he really means it this time, and it would be a shame to establish free and democratic rule over a smoldering pile of mutilated corpses.


Unfortunately for our noble cause, only the freshly-built fleet carrier DMS Talleyrand and a small patrol force are available in-system at the moment; nobody said when you joined the rebellion that it was going to be easy, or that you were likely to live through it.

They shall not pass!
