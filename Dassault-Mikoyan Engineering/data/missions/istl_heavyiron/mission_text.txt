United Securities detachment Juno has requested help dealing with a particularly large and vigorous slaver fleet. Novy Mir Starforge has dispatched the aging Baikal-class cruiser Rokossovsky in response.

The slaver group has formed up in Valjean's dust ring, and seems to be hoping that sufficient damage to the mercenary force will allow them to retreat with at least some of their living cargo.

You're still outnumbered, of course, but numbers only count for so much when the heavy iron comes out to play.
